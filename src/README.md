# Real-Time chat application using Socket.io in Node.js

In this project, a real-time chat application has been developed which will run on local machine.
This page can be opened in as many windows as the user wants. If a message is sent from one window, it will be displayed in every windows. 
So, it is just like a real-time web-page opened in multiple clients’ browser which are connected to a common server, i.e, localhost.
